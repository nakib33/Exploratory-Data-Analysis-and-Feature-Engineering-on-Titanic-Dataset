# Exploratory Data Analysis and Feature Engineering on Titanic Dataset

##Overview

This repository contains an in-depth exploration and feature engineering process applied to the Titanic dataset, typically used for predictive modeling challenges. The project is structured into two main parts:

- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Feature Engineering and Data Cleaning
The goal is to uncover key insights, identify trends, and prepare the dataset for further machine learning tasks, such as building predictive models for Titanic survival prediction.
